# Dodge-the-blocks

I tried making a game using python with the pygame library, for some reason pyinstaller considered the .exe file as a virus

In order to run the .exe, you need to put it in an exclusion list and it is mostly safe.

A simple game where you have to dodge the falling blocks. Use Left and Right arrow keys to move
